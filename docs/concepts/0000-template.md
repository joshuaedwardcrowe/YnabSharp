<!--
Style, from real review feedback on earlier concept docs:
- One idea per paragraph. If a paragraph does two things, split it.
- Prefer a list or table over a dense sentence chaining multiple
  branches/clauses with arrows or semicolons.
- Don't cram more than 2-3 inline-code names into one sentence — pick
  the ones that matter and drop or defer the rest.
- Define or avoid jargon on first use; if a reader would ask "what?",
  rephrase instead of assuming the term lands.
- In a Q&A entry, check the answer actually resolves the literal
  question asked, not just adjacent context.
- If you mention a known bug/gap, say plainly whether it's tracked or
  already fixed — don't let it read as narrative color.

# Title

## Premise

What this subsystem is and why it exists — the context a reader needs
before "Problem" makes sense.

## Problem

The specific challenge this part of YnabSharp solves. Concrete, not
abstract.

## Solution

Progressive disclosure of how it actually works — real class/method
names, real signatures, worked examples using code that exists in the
repo today. Verify every name and signature against source before
writing it down; don't describe intended or aspirational behavior as if
it's current.

## Constraints & tradeoffs

Design decisions and the alternatives that lost, in brief. If a specific
decision here already has (or deserves) its own ADR, link it instead of
re-explaining it.

## Questions & answers

Common "how do I..." and "why does it..." questions a consumer would
actually ask, answered directly.
